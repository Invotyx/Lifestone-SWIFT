# Lifestone
Lifestone is a project built for remembering the loved ones and managing events and memories related to them. The main modules of the applicaiton include
* User module
* Lifestones management
* Will management
* Image recognition and OCR implementation
* Family tree

## Image recognition and OCR
For lifestone creation and searching the models were trained to detect and scan only the lifestones and perform search based on text found on it.

## Family tree
The family tree has been developed which can grow upwards with parents and grandparents, horizontally by adding siblings, and downwards by adding children and grandchildren. 
The most challenging part of the family tree has been its design implementation on mobile devices cosidering the designing and screen size constraints.
